# Predicting Frequent High-Calorie Food Consumption (FAVC) in Diabetes Patients

This project aims to predict whether a diabetes patient frequently consumes high-calorie food (FAVC) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore the link between patient behavior and high-calorie food intake, which can be important for managing diabetes risk.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about diabetes patients, including features related to their health and habits. The target variable is **FAVC** (Yes/No), indicating whether the patient frequently consumes high-calorie food.

## Tools and Technologies

This project uses:

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Excel

## Data Processing

Data cleaning and exploration were performed using Excel and Pandas. The dataset was then prepared for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing where needed.

## Modeling

A **Random Forest Classifier** was used to train the model. Feature importance was evaluated, and the model showed strong performance in classifying FAVC behavior among patients.

## Results

The model provided solid predictive results. It successfully identified key factors contributing to frequent high-calorie food consumption.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I learned that behavior-related health data, such as eating habits, can be effectively analyzed using machine learning. Preprocessing the data properly was essential to getting reliable results. I also realized how powerful Random Forest can be in handling classification problems, especially when the data contains mixed feature types. Most importantly, I gained hands-on experience turning real-world behavior into measurable, predictive insights.
