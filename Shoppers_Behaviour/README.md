# Shoppers Behavior Clustering with HDBSCAN

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patterns in online shopper behavior. By using clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN along with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), we uncover natural groupings in customer session data.

A simple interactive dashboard is built using **Streamlit** to explore clusters and feature patterns.

## üîç Dataset Overview

The dataset is from Kaggle.
The dataset contains online shopping session data with the following features:

- **Numerical**: Page durations, BounceRates, ExitRates, PageValues
- **Categorical**: VisitorType, Browser, Region, TrafficType
- **Target (for EDA)**: `Revenue` (not used in clustering)

Total features used after encoding: **~60**

## Clustering Techniques Used

| Algorithm  | Description                     | Clusters Found | Silhouette Score |
|------------|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| K-Means    | Centroid-based, fixed `k`       | 4              | 0.373            |
| DBSCAN     | Density-based, auto cluster num | 109            | 0.551            |
| HDBSCAN    | Hierarchical DBSCAN             | 308            | **0.754** ‚úÖ      |

## Dashboard (Streamlit)

An interactive web app was built using Streamlit to:

- Explore cluster profiles
- Visualize UMAP-reduced clusters in 2D
- View top features for each cluster

To run the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run hdbscan_dashboard.py
```

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repo

2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run hdbscan_dashboard.py with Streamlit

4. Explore clustering results in your browser!
